  %em Elder Cockatrice Highlander (ECH)
  is a custom eternal Constructed multiplayer format modeled after <a href="commander">Commander</a>.

%p
  Decks consist of 100 cards, one of which is a legendary creature chosen as a commander, and a sideboard of up to 10 cards.

%p
  Except for basic lands, all cards are allowed in only 1 copy. No card is allowed if its color identity contains colors outside color identity of the chosen commander.

%p
  Unlike <a href="fusion-dragon-highlander">Fusion Dragon Highlander</a>, all cards must be from custom sets. The included sets and banlist are also different.
