  %em Custom Commander
  also known as
  %em Custom EDH
  is a custom eternal Constructed multiplayer format modeled after <a href="commander">Commander</a>.

%p
  Decks consist of 100 cards and no sideboard, one of which is a legendary creature chosen as a commander.

%p
  Except for basic lands, all cards are allowed in only 1 copy. No card is allowed if its color identity contains colors outside color identity of the chosen commander.

%p
  The commander must be a custom card, and the main deck must contain at least 15 custom nonland cards. The remaining cards may be custom or real Magic cards.

%p
  Real cards use the same card pool and banlist as <a href="commander">Commander</a>, with the exception that no un-cards are legal. Custom cards use the same card pool and banlist as <a href="custom-eternal">Custom Eternal</a>.
